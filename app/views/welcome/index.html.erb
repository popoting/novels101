Sticky top
Position an element at the top of the viewport, from edge to edge, but only after you scroll past it. The .sticky-top utility uses CSS’s position: sticky, which isn’t fully supported in all browsers.

Microsoft Edge and IE11 will render position: sticky as position: relative. As such, we wrap the styles in a @supports query, limiting the stickiness to only browsers that properly can render it.
